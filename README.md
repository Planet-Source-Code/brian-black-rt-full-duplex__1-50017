## RT Full Duplex


</div>

### Description

The purpose of this program is to provide a way to stream the aural sounds captured from a capture device(microphone) to a sound device in real time. Full Duplex Without Any Latency Is The Goal!! Currently i have not found any other example that can provide this ability. Now The program does have a latency issue, but it still is the best that i have seen. Try It Out!! if anyone can find a way to get this to provide better performance pleeze let me know.
 
### More Info
 
U need to have directx 8 installed on the box. Note when using the program the user might want to play with the physical size of the capture buffer and sound buffer, this can help alittle with the quallity issue. Also Mess with the interval of the timer, this helps with the latency issue. I Cannot figure this problem out, maybe the design is bad. Have Fun, Vote For Me!!

This version only handles one sound card. I am developing software that will provide this ability using up to 4 sound cards in the same machine..
